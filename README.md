# Toronto-Weather-Forecast
This project, developed on Databricks, focuses on analysing Toronto's 10-day weather forecast. The first notebook combines data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) with the creation of various visualisations using Apache Spark. The second notebook presents a dedicated dashboard that showcases these visualisations, providing an interactive and comprehensive overview of Toronto's upcoming weather patterns.
